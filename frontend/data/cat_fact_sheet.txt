Cats are small, carnivorous mammals that have been domesticated for thousands of years. They are known for their agility, independence, and keen hunting abilities.

Most domestic cats weigh between 3.5 and 4.5 kg, and they can live up to 15 years or more. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt vermin.

They communicate through vocalizations like meowing and purring, as well as body language. Unlike dogs, cats do not have a strong social hierarchy, and tend to be solitary hunters.

The domestic cat is believed to have been domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC.

Interesting behaviors include kneading with their paws, hiding in small spaces, and sudden energy bursts known as “zoomies.”

In ancient Egypt, cats were worshipped and often mummified. Harming a cat was considered a serious crime.

Cats have excellent night vision and can hear ultrasonic sounds made by rodents.

Fun fact: A group of cats is called a clowder.
