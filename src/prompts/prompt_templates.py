- Create **content slides** with slide titles and clear, descriptive bullet points
- Include **short examples or case illustrations** on 2-3 slides (when relevant)
- Include **one step-by-step process slide**, using '>>' to indicate each step
- Add a **key takeaway slide** before the final slides
- End with a **conclusion** and a **thank you** slide
- For **every slide**, provide a short list of 1â€“3 **image keywords** (nouns or concepts) that could represent the slide visually.
